        <br/>This Google Slides presentation highlights my work promoting diversity and inclusion in tech. Alongside a research partner, I co-designed the MyTurn program, which encourages middle school girls to explore computing through hands-on learning. I helped develop the program’s curriculum to build confidence, belonging, and computational thinking skills. I also contributed to the technical side by testing social robots and writing code to determine which model best supported student engagement. In addition, I created a wireframe for a digital tool that guided students through their projects. After the presentation, I continued working on related studies focused on mentorship among college women in computing and the kinds of tech activities that interest middle school girls most. I also assisted with data analysis for a study on how robots’ gestures affect students’ problem-solving in geometry. Overall, this project deepened my passion for using technology and research to create more inclusive and inspiring learning environments.

        <br/>In this short 5-minute presentation, I share my experience from a 3-week internship with U.S. Soccer in May 2021. As a team lead, I helped coordinate communication between mentors and interns to keep everyone aligned and working together. Our team designed and presented a new intranet prototype on SharePoint, which was a great opportunity to be creative and think practically about internal workflows. I also worked across different tech departments, taking on tasks like updating Zoom phone systems and building email templates in Salesforce. This experience taught me a lot about collaboration, adaptability, and bringing ideas to life in a fast-paced environment.
