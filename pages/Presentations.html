        <br/>This Google Slide presentation stands as a testament to my extensive work in promoting diversity and inclusion within tech fields. Collaborating closely with a research partner, I co-designed and implemented the MyTurn program, aiming to inspire middle school girls to engage in computing-related domains. My contributions were multifaceted: I curated the program curriculum, focusing on fostering a sense of belonging and honing computational thinking skills. Additionally, I conducted rigorous research, testing social robots and developing code to identify the most effective robot for the program. I also created a user-friendly digital tool's wireframe, guiding students in their project development journey. Following the presentation, my involvement continued. I spearheaded studies on mentorship dynamics among college-aged women in computing and discerned the preferences of middle school girls for tech-related extracurricular activities. Furthermore, I delved into data entry for a study analyzing the impact of robots' gestures on students' geometric problem-solving abilities, showcasing my analytical prowess. This presentation not only encapsulates my achievements but also signifies a commitment to empowering the future of tech through education and research.

        <br/>In this concise 5-minute presentation, I encapsulate my enriching 3-week internship with US Soccer in May 2021. As a team leader, I facilitated seamless communication between mentors and a group of interns, fostering collaboration and unity. Together, we designed and presented a forward-thinking intranet prototype on SharePoint, a testament to our creativity and adaptability. Additionally, I actively engaged with various tech departments, undertaking diverse tasks such as updating Zoom phone numbers and crafting email templates in Salesforce. Join me in celebrating this transformative journey, highlighting the power of teamwork, innovation, and hands-on learning.
