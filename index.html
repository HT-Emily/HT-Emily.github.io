    <p>Hello world! I'm Emily Carroso, a passionate and driven Computer Science enthusiast with a fervor for crafting engaging, impactful video game experiences. My journey began with the enchantment of video games in my childhood, and since then, I've pursued my dream of contributing to this dynamic realm with unwavering dedication.</p>

    <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I'm slated to graduate in December 2023. My academic voyage has been a tapestry of skills and knowledge, ranging from proficiency in languages such as C, C++, C#, SQL, and Python, to hands-on experience with Unity and versatile web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>

    <p>My quest for holistic learning extends beyond classrooms. I've embraced roles such as Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where I delved into the realms of augmented and virtual reality, exploring their potential in education and healthcare. My tenure as an Intern and Unity Developer at the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory provided me with industry insight, fostering my passion for crafting meaningful, industry-relevant experiences.</p>

    <p>My journey also includes collaborations on diverse projects. &quot;MindfulMagic,&quot; a mobile app designed to combat the negative impacts of social media, showcases my commitment to harnessing technology for positive change. I co-created &quot;Know! Parent Tips Hub,&quot; a platform that aids parents in fostering productive conversations with their children on crucial subjects.</p>

    <p>As a member of the Association for Computing Machinery Student Chapter and Women in Computer Science, I actively engage in the vibrant academic community. Beyond academics, I've made an impact as a leader in various roles, from being a former President of the Collegiate Panhellenic Council to my contributions in Delta Phi Epsilon's Beta Rho Chapter, where I orchestrated philanthropic initiatives and promoted health and wellness awareness.</p>

    <p>My ultimate goal is to fuse my coding prowess with my passion for storytelling, art, and music to create games that transcend entertainment, driving positive change in diverse fields. Looking ahead, I envision a future where my creations not only entertain but also educate, inspire, and heal. Whether through contributing to the industry or guiding the next generation of designers and technologists, my love for video games propels me forward.</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey. Explore my portfolio to witness my evolution, projects, and aspirations unfold. Let's connect and make strides in reshaping the future of interactive experiences.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>Emily Carroso</p>
