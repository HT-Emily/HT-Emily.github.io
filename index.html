    <p>Hi, I’m Emily Carroso, a software developer with a passion for creating meaningful, human-centered digital experiences. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Chicago, where I built a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and design.</p>
    
    <p>During my time at UIC, I worked as both a teaching and research assistant, contributing to projects that explored the use of virtual reality in healthcare and education. I also interned at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where I helped develop VR training simulations for the Department of Defense. That experience strengthened my technical skills and my ability to collaborate across disciplines.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of work, I love combining creativity and technology, whether that’s through designing user-friendly interfaces, composing music, or exploring new ways software can make a positive impact. I’m always learning, building, and finding ways to create technology that feels intuitive and purposeful.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for visiting. Feel free to explore my portfolio or reach out to connect.</p>
